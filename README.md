# Hi there, I'm Ondřej! 👋

## About Me

I'm a passionate programmer who has been interested in coding since 8th grade. Currently, I'm studying at a high school with a focus on IT Application Development. 
My main expertise lies in frontend web development with React and TailwindCSS, but I also enjoy working on Minecraft plugins using Java and the Spigot/Bukkit API in my spare time. 
I am also interested in game development, specifically 2D pixel art games, so I am occasionally learning Godot, that is really great for it.

## Projects

### [Rick and Morty React Web App](https://github.com/florixak/RickAndMortyReactApp)
A React-based web application that utilizes the Rick and Morty API to display information about the show's characters, episodes, and locations. This project showcases my skills in React, TailwindCSS and API integration.

### [UHCRun Revamp](https://github.com/florixak/UHCRun-Revamp)
Minecraft minigame, that I'm developing in my free time. This project is built using Java with the Spigot/Bukkit API and demonstrates my ability to create engaging and interactive gaming experiences. Game is inspired by minigame
